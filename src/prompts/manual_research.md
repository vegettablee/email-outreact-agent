PHASE 1 — COMPANY
Extract: legal name, size, industry category, city, state, one-sentence description.

1. careers@ / hiring@
2. hr@ / people@ / talent@
3. Named founder or CEO email (small companies only)
4. hello@ / info@

INTEGRITY CONSTRAINT: Only return emails directly observed on a public page. Do not infer, construct, or pattern-match unless the naming convention was explicitly confirmed on that domain. If uncertain → omit.

PHASE 3 — RECRUITERS (in priority order)
1. recruiter@ / recruiting@ / recruitment@ / staffing@
2. Named individuals with titles: "Recruiter", "Talent Acquisition", "TA Partner", "Sourcer" → find their email
3. ta@ / talentacquisition@ / sourcingteam@
4. IF recruiter email domain ≠ company domain → treat as third-party, deprioritize
5. IF no email found → return LinkedIn profile URL. Set linkedin field, leave recruiter_emails: [{}]

CONSTRAINT: Every recruiter entry MUST have email OR linkedin. If neither exists → omit the recruiter entirely.
